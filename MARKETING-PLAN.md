# Pulse Pro — Daily Marketing Plan

## The Campaign: "Break Up With Your PM Tool"

Freelancers writing breakup letters to Trello, Asana, and Notion.

### Example Posts

**Breakup Letter #1 — Asana**
> Dear Asana, We need to talk. I have 5 clients, not 500 employees. I don't need sprints. I don't need workflows. I don't need a 30-minute onboarding video to track a logo redesign. I found someone simpler. It's not you, it's... actually, yeah, it's you.

**Breakup Letter #2 — Notion**
> Notion, I loved you. But I spent more time building my project tracker than actually doing client work. I needed a tool, not a second job.

**Breakup Letter #3 — Trello**
> Trello, I don't need 47 columns for 3 clients. I just need to know what's due today. We're done.

**Why this works:**
- Extremely relatable to ICP — they've ALL felt this frustration
- Names the villains directly (controversial = engagement)
- Easy to remix — people will tag friends, share their own versions
- The "breakup" format is inherently emotional and shareable
- Naturally leads to "so what do you use now?" in the comments

Run as a series — one breakup letter per week, different tool each time. Pin the best-performing one.

## Daily Routine: The First Hour (8:00 - 9:00 AM)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 8:00 - 8:15 | **Engage** — Reply to comments on your posts, DM anyone who engaged, respond in relevant threads/groups |
| 8:15 - 8:45 | **Create** — Write and schedule today's content (see cadence below) |
| 8:45 - 9:00 | **Prospect** — Comment on 5-10 posts from your ICP (freelancers, consultants posting about work overwhelm) with genuinely helpful replies. No pitching. |

## Weekly Content Cadence

LinkedIn is the #1 channel — that's where the ICP lives professionally. X and Substack are supporting channels.

| Day | LinkedIn | X (Twitter) | Substack |
|-----|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Mon** | Pain post (the problem) | Thread version of LinkedIn post | — |
| **Tue** | Build-in-public update | Quick tip or hot take | — |
| **Wed** | Breakup letter (campaign) | Repost LinkedIn with commentary | — |
| **Thu** | Value post (how-to/tip) | Engagement bait (poll or question) | Weekly article |
| **Fri** | Social proof / milestone | Weekend reflection | — |

**Total: 5 LinkedIn posts, 5 tweets, 1 Substack article per week.**

## The 5 Content Pillars

### 1. Pain Posts (Monday)
Describe the problem your ICP feels daily.

> "You have 6 active clients. 3 are waiting on deliverables. 1 is overdue. And you're not sure which one. Sound familiar?"

> "The moment you realize you forgot to follow up with a client — and it's been 2 weeks. That sinking feeling? That's what happens when your 'system' is your memory."

> "Raise your hand if your project management system is: 1) A spreadsheet you haven't updated 2) Sticky notes on your monitor 3) Your brain (and anxiety)"

### 2. Build in Public (Tuesday)
Share what you're building, metrics, lessons.

> "Week 3 of Pulse Pro: 12 signups, 0 paying users, 1 feature request I'm obsessed with. Here's what I'm learning..."

> "Shipped a new feature last night: daily email reminders. Every morning you get an email telling you exactly what's due today. No app to open. No dashboard to check. Just: here's what needs your attention."

> "My product has 0 users and I'm shipping features at 11pm. Here's why I'm not worried..."

### 3. Villain Posts / Breakup Letters (Wednesday)
The campaign series — one tool per week.

> Use the breakup letter format above. Rotate through: Asana, Trello, Notion, Monday.com, ClickUp, Google Sheets, Sticky Notes.

Additional villain angles:
> "Asana charges $11/user/month. You're one person. You're paying enterprise pricing for a personal to-do list."

> "The irony of spending 3 hours setting up a 'productivity' tool."

### 4. Value Posts (Thursday)
Teach something useful, tool-agnostic. Build authority.

> "The 5-minute Friday review that stopped me from missing deadlines: 1. Open your task list 2. Flag anything due next week 3. Email clients about blockers 4. Close your laptop. That's it."

> "3 rules for managing multiple clients without burning out: 1. Every client gets a project, not a folder 2. Every deliverable gets a deadline, not a 'soon' 3. Every morning starts with 'what's due today,' not 'what do I feel like doing'"

> "The client management framework I wish I had 5 years ago: One page per client. Three sections: Active projects. Upcoming deadlines. Last contact date. That's it. If you can't see it in 10 seconds, your system is too complicated."

### 5. Social Proof / Milestones (Friday)
Screenshots, user quotes, numbers, wins.

> "First user told me Pulse Pro replaced their spreadsheet + sticky note system. That's the whole product thesis in one sentence."

> "Someone signed up, added 4 clients, and created 11 tasks — all in their first 8 minutes. That's the product working exactly as intended."

> "Milestone: 50 signups. 0 ad spend. All from LinkedIn posts and word of mouth. The ICP is real."

## X (Twitter) Strategy

X is for reach and discovery, not conversion. Keep it punchy.

**Threads** — Take Monday LinkedIn pain post and turn it into a 5-tweet thread.

**Hot takes** get engagement:
> "Freelancers don't need project management. They need client management. There's a difference."

> "If your PM tool has a 'Getting Started' guide longer than 1 page, it's not built for you."

> "The best project management tool is the one you actually open every day."

**Polls:**
> "What do you use to track client work?" — Spreadsheet / Notion / Trello / My brain

> "How many active clients are you juggling right now?" — 1-2 / 3-5 / 6-10 / 10+ (send help)

**Reply strategy:** Comment on creators talking about productivity, freelancing, or tool fatigue. Add genuine value, never pitch.

## Substack Strategy

One article per week, published Thursday. Long-form authority play.

### Article Types to Rotate

1. **"How I..."** — How I manage 6 clients without losing my mind
2. **"Why..."** — Why project management tools aren't built for freelancers
3. **"The X framework"** — The 3-client rule: how to know when you need a system
4. **Building Pulse Pro** — Behind-the-scenes, decisions, metrics, failures
5. **Industry takes** — The freelancer tool market is broken. Here's why.

### First 4 Articles

- **Week 1:** "Why I Built a Project Management Tool After Quitting Every Other One"
- **Week 2:** "The 5-Minute System That Stopped Me From Missing Client Deadlines"
- **Week 3:** "Freelancers Don't Need Project Management — They Need Client Management"
- **Week 4:** "Month 1 of Building Pulse Pro: Numbers, Lessons, and What's Next"

Cross-post the intro to LinkedIn and X with a "full article in comments" link to drive subscribers.

## Metrics That Matter

Track weekly. Don't chase vanity metrics.

| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Target (Month 3) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| LinkedIn impressions | 5,000/week | 20,000/week |
| LinkedIn profile views | 100/week | 300/week |
| Website visits (from social) | 50/week | 200/week |
| Signups | 10/week | 30/week |
| Free to Pro conversions | 1-2/week | 5-10/week |

## Key Positioning

**ICP:** Solo service professionals (freelancers, consultants, small agency owners) managing 2-5+ active clients.

**The Villain:** Trello, Asana, Notion, and spreadsheets — tools built for 50-person teams, not one person.

**Core message:** "You don't need a tool built for a 50-person team. You need one built for you."

**Emotional hook:** The feeling of being in control of your client work — not overwhelmed by it.

**Every post should make your ICP think "that's exactly how I feel" before they ever see a product link.**
