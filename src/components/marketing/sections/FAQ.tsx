    question: "Who is Pulse Pro for?",
    answer: "Pulse Pro is built for freelancers, consultants, and small teams who manage multiple clients and projects. If you've tried Asana, Trello, or Notion and found them too complex for your workflow, Pulse Pro is for you."
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from Trello or Asana?",
    answer: "Those tools are built for 50-person teams with sprints, boards, and complex workflows. Pulse Pro is built for people who just need to track clients, projects, and deadlines — without the overhead. You'll be up and running in under 5 minutes."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a free plan?",
    answer: "Yes. The free plan includes 3 projects, 50 tasks, and 1 client — enough to see if Pulse Pro fits your workflow before upgrading."
  },
  {
    question: "What do I get with Pro vs Team?",
    answer: "Pro ($12/mo) gives you unlimited projects, tasks, and clients, plus file attachments, Telegram bot, email reminders, and the ability to share projects with up to 3 collaborators. Team ($29/mo) includes everything in Pro plus up to 10 team members with full role-based access control — viewer, editor, and manager roles."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure?",
    answer: "Yes. Pulse Pro runs on Vercel with encrypted connections. Your data is never shared with third parties."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer refunds?",
    answer: "Yes — 30-day money-back guarantee on all paid plans. No questions asked."
  },
  {
    question: "Can my team use Pulse Pro?",
    answer: "Yes! Pro users can share projects with up to 3 collaborators. Team plan ($29/mo) supports up to 10 members with role-based access — assign viewer, editor, or manager roles per project. No per-seat fees."
