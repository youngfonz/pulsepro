            <p>By accessing or using Pulse Pro, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, you should not create an account or use the service. These terms apply to all users, including visitors, free-tier users, and paid subscribers.</p>

            <p>Pulse Pro is a project and task management tool designed for freelancers, consultants, and small teams. The service allows you to create and manage projects, tasks, clients, and deadlines in one place. We offer a free tier with limited usage (3 projects, 50 tasks, 1 client) and a paid Pro tier with unlimited access to all features.</p>

            <p>Pro subscriptions are billed monthly at $9/month. Payment is processed securely through our payment provider, Polar. You can cancel your subscription at any time — your Pro access will continue until the end of the current billing period. We do not offer prorated refunds for partial months, but refund requests are handled on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to change pricing with 30 days notice to existing subscribers.</p>
